                            <strong>Var: </strong> Var
                            Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables
                            declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to
                            emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues. <br><br>
                            <strong>Scope: </strong>Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use.
                            var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

                            The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any
                            variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the
                            whole window.

                            var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is
                            available and can be accessed only within that function.<br><br>
                            <strong>Hoisting: </strong>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function
                            declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that if
                            we do this<br><br>
                            <strong>Let is a block scope:</strong> The let keyword should be used in situations where
                            you
                            want to declare a variable that should be restricted to the block in which it is restricted.
                            Also, variables declared with the let keyword cannot be updated or re-declared. Here is an
                            example of how to use let to declare variables in JavaScript<br><br>
                            <strong>Hoisting:</strong>
                            Hoisting of let
                            Variables declared with the let keyword are not subject to hoisting. This means you cannot
                            use a variable unless it is declared and initialized.<br><br>
                            <strong>Const: </strong>The const keyword follows the same rules as the let keyword. The
                            only difference with const is that const is used to define only constant values in
                            JavaScript programs.<br><br>
                            <strong>const Declarations are Block Scoped: </strong>The scoping principles of const are
                            the same as that of the let keyword. Like let, the variables declared with the const keyword
                            will also have scope restricted to the block in which they are declared.<br><br>Some
                            important pointers for const include:

                            const declares a variable with a constant value.
                            Use the const keyword if the variable that you are declaring should not be allowed to be
                            reassigned in the future.

                            <strong>Regular function: </strong> Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka
                            the execution context) is dynamic.

                            The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In
                            JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.

                            During a simple invocation the value of this equals to the global object (or undefined if
                            the function runs in strict mode):<br><br>
                            <strong>2 Arrow function: </strong>The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs
                            considerably from the regular function's this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define
                            its own execution context.

                            No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals
                            this value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves this
                            lexically.

                            In the following example, myMethod() is an outer function of callback() arrow function:

                            Handling strings is one of the most essentials jobs for software development. In JavaScript,
                            there is special syntax for it — template strings (also called template literals).

                            It’s okay if you have never used the template strings syntax, since there are alternative
                            ways to do the same operations. But if you’re serious about JavaScript, mastering this
                            syntax sugar can make your code shorter and better.<br><br>

                            literal is to write a multi-line string directly:
